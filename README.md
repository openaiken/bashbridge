# bashbridge

## Discord/Minecraft Chat Bridge for Linux Servers

This is a fairly simple Chat Bridge for a Minecraft server running on Linux (designed for RHEL 9) and a Discord text channel.

Rename the example config file to `config.ini` and edit the contents. This bridge should be started after your server is running, and stopped before your server is stopped.
